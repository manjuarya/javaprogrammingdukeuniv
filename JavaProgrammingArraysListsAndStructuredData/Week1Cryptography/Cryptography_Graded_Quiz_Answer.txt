6.Question 6
The following phrase was encrypted with the two-key encryption method we discussed using the two keys 14 and 24. What is the decrypted message?

Hfs cpwewloj loks cd Hoto kyg Cyy.

(Note: Spacing and punctuation should be preserved in your answer.)

Incorrect  (The original name of Java was Oak)

The maxIndex value is   14
                  The key1 is 10
	The maxIndex value is   11
	The key2 is 7
	The decrypted message with 2 Key (12 & 2) is  Xyi simxmeec eedi sw Aeme arw Sro
	this is not a correct answer. the correct answer is down-
	The encrypted message with 2 Key is  The original name of Java was Oak


9.Question 9

What is the encrypted string?

(Note: Spacing and punctuation should be preserved in your encrypted message.)

Correct
1 / 1 point

2.Question 2
Encrypt the following phrase with the algorithm described for using two Caesar Cipher keys, with key1 = 21 and key2 = 8.

Can you imagine life WITHOUT the internet AND computers in your pocket?

What is the encrypted string?

(Note: Spacing and punctuation should be preserved in your encrypted message.)

Correct
1 / 1 point

3.Question 3
Consider the Caesar Cipher two-key algorithm described in this course. Every other character, starting with the first, will use the Caesar Cipher algorithm with key1, and every other character, starting with the second, will use the Caesar Cipher algorithm with key2.

Assume shiftedAlphabet1 is the shifted alphabet using key1 and shiftedAlphabet2 is the shifted alphabet using key2, both are of type String.

If i is the location of the current character in the message, and idx is the integer variable of the location of the current character in the original alphabet, which one of the following segments of code correctly gets the corresponding encrypted character?

Correct
