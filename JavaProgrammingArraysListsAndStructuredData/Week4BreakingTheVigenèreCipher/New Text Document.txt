Breaking the Vigenère Cipher
TOTAL POINTS 7

1.Question 1
What is the language of secretmessage3.txt?

French


2.Question 2
What is the first line of the message you decrypted from secretmessage3.txt?

La chambre à coucher de Juliette.


3.Question 3
What is the language of secretmessage4.txt?

German

t

4.Question 4
What is the first line of the message you decrypted from secretmessage4.txt?

Drei Hexen treten auf.


5.Question 5
Recall that the choice to test key lengths 1–100 was arbitrary, and that the longer a key is with respect to an encrypted message, 
the less likely this Vigenère decryption algorithm is to work.

How long would a key have to be, so that you could gain no information about an original message by analyzing the encrypted message?

Exactly the message length



6.Question 6
The Vigenère decryption algorithm used in this lesson has limitations.

In which of the following scenarios could the program return incorrect results? (Select all that are correct.)


The language of the original message has multiple letters of comparable high frequency.


The language of the original message is not included in the dictionaries.


The language of the original message has an unusual letter that is highest in frequency (not 'e' or 'a').




7.Question 7
Consider the Vigenère decryption algorithm described in this lesson.

Which one of the following could be a problem?


The key length is long compared with the message.
