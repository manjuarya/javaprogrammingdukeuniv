1. Suppose the line  markov.setRandom(18); is put between lines 7 and 8, 

Ans. Each of three randomly generated texts will all be identical.

2. runMarkovZero method, set the random seed to 1024 and run this method on the file confucius.txt.
What is the first line of text output when this program runs?

Ans.  eeuefmespwhsfoyu, s giowhersa eell; bma s.7shni:.at.ttdr.w aknf 

3. In the Tester class, run the program testGetFollowsWithFile with the string “o” and the file confucius.txt.
What is the size of the ArrayList of characters that follow “o”?

Ans. 10453

4. In the Tester class, run the program testGetFollowsWithFile with the string “he” and the file confucius.txt.
What is the size of the ArrayList of characters that follow “he”?

Ans. 3715

5. After the completion of the MarkovOne class to generate random text by finding all the characters that follow 
one character, set the random seed in the runMarkovOne method in the MarkovRunner class to 365. 
Then run runMarkovOne on the file romeo.txt.
What is the first line generated?

Ans.  y O wirs bloay Ger. fo. tifthy The, A My; st- ie d, s. bloulate, 

6. After the completion of the MarkovFour class to generate random text by finding all the characters that follow 
four characters, set the random seed in the runMarkovFour method in the MarkovRunner class to 715. Then run 
runMarkovFour on the file romeo.txt
What is the first line of text generated?

Ans.  man in a green, for that haste, for a foot in her from Tybalt! 

7. After the completion of the MarkovModel class to generate random text by finding all the characters that follow 
N characters, set the random seed in the runMarkovModel method in the MarkovRunner class to 953 and pass in 
N as 7. Then run runMarkovModel on the file romeo.txt.
What is the first line of text generated?

Ans. e uncle Capulet's orchard. Enter an officer, and light- more 

8. For the class EfficientMarkovModel, which one of the following is the best place to call the buildMap method?

Ans.  In the constructor. OR  In the getRandomText method before the for loop.

9. In the EfficientMarkovModel class, comment out the print statements in the printHashMapInfo method that 
prints out the map. Make sure printHashMapInfo is called right after the HashMap is built. Then in the 
MarkovRunnerWithInterface class call the runModel method on an EfficientMarkovModel of order 6 with 
seed 792 on the file confucius.txt.
How many keys are in the HashMap?

Ans. 70162

10. In the EfficientMarkovModel class, comment out the print statements in the printHashMapInfo method that 
prints out the map. Make sure printHashMapInfo is called right after the HashMap is built. Then in the 
MarkovRunnerWithInterface class call the runModel method on an EfficientMarkovModel of order 5 with 
seed 531 on the file confucius.txt.
What was the size of the largest ArrayList in the HashMap?

Ans. The maximum value is: 1549  & its key:  the
